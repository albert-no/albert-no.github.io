= Thesis
- Rateless Lossy Compression via the Extremes (Advisor: prof. Tsachy Weissman)\n
The aim of my thesis research is to understand successive refinement more thoroughly
 so that we can use its ideas to construct a practical lossy compressor
 with theoretically attractive properties.
I proposed an iterative lossy compressor achieving the information theoretic optimum
 distortion-rate bound with low computational complexity,
 low storage requirements, and additional properties of both theoretical and practical merit.
